# Light Sensors

#### Project Overview

The **Light Sensors** project demonstrates how to use a light sensor with an Arduino Mega to measure and detect ambient light levels. This project reads the analog voltage from the light sensor and prints the light intensity values to the Serial Monitor, providing feedback on whether the environment is bright or dim based on a defined threshold.

#### Components Needed

- **Arduino Mega**
- **Light Sensor (e.g., LDR or light-dependent resistor)**
- **Resistor (optional, for voltage divider)**
- **Jumper Wires**

#### Block Diagram


#### Circuit Setup

1. **Connect the Light Sensor to Arduino Mega:**
   - **Light Sensor Pin:** Connect to analog pin A0 on the Arduino Mega.
   - **VCC:** Connect to 5V on Arduino (or use a voltage divider if needed).
   - **GND:** Connect to GND on Arduino.

   *Note: Depending on the light sensor's resistance range, you may need to use a resistor in series (voltage divider configuration) to ensure the voltage is within the ADC's range.*

#### Instructions

1. **Circuit Setup:**
   - Connect the light sensor to the Arduino Mega as described in the circuit setup section.

2. **Code Upload:**
   - Open the Arduino IDE and create a new sketch.
   - Copy and paste the provided Arduino code into the sketch.
   - Upload the code to the Arduino Mega.

3. **Testing:**
   - Open the Serial Monitor in the Arduino IDE (set to 9600 baud).
   - Observe the Serial Monitor for the light intensity values printed as sensor readings.
   - The Serial Monitor will also display whether bright or dim light is detected based on the defined threshold.

#### Applications

- **Automatic Lighting Control:** Adjust lighting based on ambient light levels.
- **Environmental Monitoring:** Measure light intensity in indoor or outdoor environments.
- **Energy Efficiency:** Implement energy-saving strategies based on natural light availability.

#### Notes

- Ensure the light sensor is exposed to the light source you intend to measure.
- Calibrate readings as needed based on environmental conditions and sensor placement.
- Experiment with different resistors in the voltage divider to optimize sensitivity and range.
